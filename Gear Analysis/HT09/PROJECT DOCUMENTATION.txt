GOAL:

1. Create KissSoft load profile to import into kissSoft for lifetime gear analysis
	-previously used Result.mat (pretty sure this is a lapsim output)
	-going to use 2024 competition data for HT09 simulation

2. Calculate stresses in gears via MATLAB Script
	-attempted for HT07/08, didn't end up using because it always claimed the gears would fail even if kissSoft said they would pass
