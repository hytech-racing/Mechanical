This simulation model was originally created for ME 4013, Hybrid Vehicle Powertrains.  
It was modified by Brandon Strecker and Christian Free for a Formula Hybrid concept (final project) and then simplified to Hytech.

Basic HyTech parameters have been added but may not be entirely accurate.  The model is relatively self-explanatory in the signal flow.

Files are:

TOP LEVEL:
HyTech_Simulink.slx ---------- This is the model file.  Open and go to the main page to see a To-Do list.
Vehicle_Init_File_L3.m ------- This is a used to modify common parameters and load data.
Vehicle_Post_File.m ---------- This is a used to post-process data. Currently, it only displays distance and delta SOC in a dialog box.
ME 4013 Tutorial.pptx -------- This outlines step-by-step the tutorial that was used to build this model.  Lots of important details here.

"Component_Data" FOLDER:  Toggle selection of these files in the init file.
Battery_Data.mat ------------- This is data for the battery.  
MG_Data_Continuous.mat ------- This is data for the motor, with continuous torque limits.

"Drive_Cycles" FOLDER:  Toggle selection of these files in the init file.
Make_Endurance.m -------------- This is used to modify the Schedule_Accel file to make other files.
Schedule_Accel.mat ------------ This is a drive cycle for the acceleration event.  Creates maximum torque request for all time.
Schedule_Autocross.mat -------- This is a drive cycle for the autocross event.  Initially generated from Christian's lap sim for the Formula Hybrid concept, but likely still useful for HyTech.
Schedule_Autocross_1km.mat ---- This is a drive cycle for the autocross event, modified from the original to be repeatable (v(1) == v(end)) and as close to 1 km (1.0055 km) as possible for easy concatenation.
Schedule_Endurance_22km.mat --- This is a drive cycle for the endurance event.  It is the 1km Autocross concatenated 22 times.  Actual distance is 22.12 km.

"slprj" FOLDER:  Not sure what it is used for.  Seems to be generated by MATLAB.  Has not been deleted before.  Would not recommend deleting.  Does not really harm anything.
